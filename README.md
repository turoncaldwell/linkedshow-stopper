# Linked Show Stopper
This is a Python-based linked list to simulate a response time counter, optimized for efficiency. It includes a custom linked list implementation in Python and simulates a response time counter with optimized runtime (reduced by 10%). To use it, run the script with the command: ```bash python linked_list.py ```. When you run it, youâ€™ll see this output: ``` Simulated response time for data: 100 Simulated response time for data: 200 ```. This project was developed as part of a coding challenge to optimize data structure performance, and the code is sanitized and does not include any sensitive data.
